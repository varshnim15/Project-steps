# Project-steps
step by step implementation 
Step-by-Step Implementation:

1. Local Development Setup
 - Create a Flask application
 - Implement Celery with Redis for background tasks
 - Configure Gunicorn as the WSGI server
 - Set up Nginx to serve static files
 - Create Docker containers for each service

2. Containerization
 - Write a docker-compose.yml file
 - Define services: Flask app, Redis, Nginx
 - Ensure containers can communicate seamlessly
 - Test local deployment and service interactions

3. Cloud Infrastructure Preparation
 - Set up AWS account (free tier available)
 - Create VPC with public and private subnets
 - Provision RDS PostgreSQL instance
 - Prepare for ECS deployment

4. Terraform Infrastructure
 - Write Terraform modules for:
 * VPC configuration
 * Subnets (public and private)
 * Application Load Balancer (ALB)
 * ECS cluster and services
 * Security groups
 * Route53 for domain management
 - Implement best practices for infrastructure as code
 - Configure SSL certificates for secure connections

5. Service Architecture
 - Place Nginx behind load balancer
 - Position Flask app with Redis for Celery
 - Use AWS Service Connect for service discovery
 - Ensure proper network segmentation

6. Continuous Deployment
 - Create GitHub Actions workflow
 - Automate build process
 - Implement deployment to AWS ECS
 - Add steps for:
 * Code building
 * Docker image creation
 * Terraform infrastructure updates
 * Application deployment

7. Network and Security
 - Place ALB in public subnet
 - Deploy services in private networks
 - Implement secure communication paths
 - Configure domain routing
 - Set up SSL certificates
